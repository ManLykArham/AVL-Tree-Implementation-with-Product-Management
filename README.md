# 🌳 AVL Tree Implementation with Product Management

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

This project involves creating an **AVL Tree** a self-balancing binary search tree to efficiently manage and track a collection of products. By implementing **automatic balancing** using single and double rotations, the tree ensures optimal search and retrieval times. The system features product management capabilities such as **adding products**, **checking for specific products**, **counting the total number of products**, and tracking how many times each product has been added. Additionally, various **tree traversal methods** (in-order, pre-order, and post-order) provide flexible viewing options for the stored products. 🛠️

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Tree Balancing**: Self-balances using single and double rotations for efficient data management.
- **Product Management**: Add, search, and count product entries.
- **Traversal Methods**: View stored products using in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Optimised operations for quick product search and insertion.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Add Products**: Input product names to add them to the AVL tree.
2. **Display Products**: Choose from in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal methods to display the products.
3. **Check Product Existence**: Input a product name to check if it exists in the tree and how many times it has been added.

### 📊 Example Usage

- Add products: `"Laptop"`, `"Phone"`, `"Tablet"`.
- Check for **"Laptop"**.

**Expected Output**:  
`"Laptop found, added 1 time."`
