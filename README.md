# AVL Tree Implementation with Product Management

This project implements an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, to efficiently manage and track products. The tree automatically balances itself through single and double rotations during insertions to maintain optimal search and retrieval times. The project features methods to add products, count the total number of products, check for specific products, and determine how many times a product has been added. The tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) allow for various ways to view the stored products.

## Instructions:

### Add Products:

Input product names to add them to the AVL tree.

### Display Products:

Choose from in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal methods to display the products.

### Check Product Existence:

Input a product name to check if it exists in the tree and the number of times it has been added.

### Example:

Add products: "Laptop", "Phone", "Tablet".
Check for "Laptop", and the system will confirm if it exists.

### Expected output: 

"Laptop found, added 1 time."
