AVL Tree Implementation with Product Management

This project implements an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, to efficiently manage and track products. The tree automatically balances itself through single and double rotations during insertions to maintain optimal search and retrieval times. The project features methods to add products, count the total number of products, check for specific products, and determine how many times a product has been added. The tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) allow for various ways to view the stored products.
